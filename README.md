# React + Vite Project (Kanban)

In this project I've implemented a simple kanban

This Kanban has four columns (backlog, To do, In progress, Completed) and the user is able to perform the following actions:
- Create a card
- Delete a card
- Move cards between column
- Move the cards within the same column

The technologies used were:
- React
- TailwindCSS for styling 
- FramerMotion for animation

## ðŸ’¡
Keep in mind that the directory structure of the components is organized in a way I'm used to work with when there's only the .jsx file and its corresponding .css file. So, as this is my first project working with tailwind I might have not used the right file organization :/
